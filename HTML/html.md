# HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

## 1) Basic Structure of an HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

```
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and links.

## 2) Common HTML Tags
  
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading tags, where `<h1>` is the highest level and `<h6>` is the lowest.
- `<p>`: Paragraph tag, used for blocks of text.
- `<a>`: Anchor tag, used to create hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: Image tag, used to embed images in the document.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered list tags, respectively.
- `<li>`: List item tag, used within `<ul>` and `<ol>` to define individual list items.
- `<div>`: Division tag, used to group elements for styling or scripting purposes.
- `<span>`: Inline container tag, used to group inline elements for styling or scripting purposes.

## 3) Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.
Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```
In this example, `href` is an attribute of the `<a>` tag that specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
## Conclusion
HTML is the backbone of web development, allowing developers to structure content on the web. Understanding HTML is essential for creating websites and web applications.
