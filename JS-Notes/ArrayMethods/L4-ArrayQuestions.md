🔴 Level 4: Advanced / Real-world

Group users by role from an array of objects.

Count frequency of elements in [a, b, a, c, b, a].

Sort users by name case-insensitive.

Update one object in an array immutably.

Remove an item by id from state in React.

Paginate an array (page size = 5).

Find missing number in [1,2,3,5].

Chain array methods to get double of even numbers.

🎯 Bonus: Output-based questions (VERY COMMON)

What is the output?

[1,2,3].map(x => x + 1);

[1,2,3].forEach(x => x * 2);

[10,20,30].filter(x => x > 15);

[1,2,3].reduce((a,b) => a + b);

["1","2","3"].map(Number);
